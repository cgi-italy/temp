This message indicates that one of two things is happening:

* **First Time Login:** A new private server is being created specifically for you. Additionally, dedicated storage space for your personal data is being established.

* **Subsequent Logins:** A new private server is being created for you. Your dedicated storage space is already available for you. The system will simply link the private server with the existing storage.

This process typically takes only a few seconds, but it may take up to a minute to complete.

Once the provisioning or connection process is finished, you will be directed to the main server interface. This interface will provide you with various options to manage your private server and access your data storage:
