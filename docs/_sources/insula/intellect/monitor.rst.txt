Monitor your processing
=======================

Once a service execution is running, it is possible to monitor it.

* Visit the https://insula.destine.eu/sir,
* Click on *Open monitoring page*,
* See the page for "Your latest processing". It might be empty, if there are no recent executions.
* Click on *See all*,
* See an interface showing service executions, similar to the following:

This interface allows to filter and sort service executions, and retrieve additional information for each of them.
For a service execution, it is possible to retrieve:

* The list of inputs.
* The list of outputs.
* The execution logs, for debugging.

It is possible to download the outputs, to open and visualise them in :ref:`perception` (if the outputs are suitable for visualization), or to share them with other users. For example:
