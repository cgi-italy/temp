Key concepts
++++++++++++

The following key concepts are used throughout these pages:

- A **Bookmark** is a logical grouping of satellite products and/or Output products and/or reference data held together for a particular purpose. A Bookmark is identified by a name and a description. Users can view and manage their Bookmarks either within the Data Panel or the Manage & Share interface.
- A **Group** is a collection of users with a common interest. Groups allow users to both communicate and share material within a selected number of peers. They are managed via the Manage & Share interface.
- A **Service** is a data processing or visualisation application, or workflows made available to the users.
- A **Job** is a specific data processing activity that has been instigated by the user. Clicking on the Jobs section of the Data Panel allows users to explore Job status. If it has multiple input products, then a job may also be comprised of several subjobs.
- A **Collection** is a group of data grouped together due to their common nature. For example, the set of all outputs of a given service would typically be grouped as a Collection.
