Examples
========

Insula Code Lab provides a set of ready-to-use examples to help you in the learning process. These examples are automatically downloaded upon your first login and can be found in your user workspace under the folder named "getting-started".

Accessing the Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++

* **Locate the folder:** Navigate to your user workspace and open the "getting-started" folder.
* **Choose an Example:** Within the folder, you'll find several notebook files with ".ipynb" extensions. These notebooks contain code examples and explanations.

Running the Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++

Since the examples are primarily in Python, they leverage Jupyter Notebook format. To run an example:

* **Double-Click the Notebook:** Open the desired ".ipynb" file by double-clicking on it.
* **Execute Cells:** Jupyter Notebooks allow you to execute code snippets one by one or in sequence. Look for buttons or keyboard shortcuts within the interface to execute individual cells or the entire notebook.


Understanding the Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The examples are designed to be self-explanatory. Each notebook includes comments and explanations directly within the code cells, guiding you through the steps.

Additional Resources
